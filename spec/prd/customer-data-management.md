# Customer Data Management System

Version 0.1.3

## Overview
Our small business needs a simple system to register new customers and track their current status. We currently manage customer information manually through spreadsheets, which is becoming inefficient as we grow. We need a basic digital solution to streamline customer data management.

## Goals
- Enable staff to quickly register new customers
- Track customer status for better service management
- Replace manual spreadsheet-based customer tracking
- Improve data accuracy and accessibility

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Register new customers with basic contact information
- Update customer status through business development lifecycle (lead, contacted, qualified, in negotiation, closed-won, closed-lost, active, dormant)
- View list of all registered customers
- Search customers by name or contact information

### Non-Functional Requirements
- System should be accessible by up to 5 staff members
- Data must be stored securely
- Simple, intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## User Stories
- As a business development representative, I want to register new prospects so that we can track their information digitally
- As a business development representative, I want to update prospect status so that I can track where each potential customer is in our sales pipeline
- As a staff member, I want to search for customers so that I can quickly find their information
- As a sales manager, I want to see all prospects and their pipeline status so that I can forecast revenue and identify bottlenecks

## Success Metrics
- 100% of new customers registered digitally within 2 weeks
- Reduce time spent on customer data lookup by 50%
- Zero customer data loss incidents

## Open Questions
- What specific customer information fields do we need beyond name and contact info?
- Should we integrate with any existing systems or tools we currently use?
- Do we need any reporting features beyond basic customer lists?

## Dependencies
- None specified - this is a standalone system
